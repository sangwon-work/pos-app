This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Node 버전 20.19.4
- nvm use 20.19.4
## java 버전 17.0.14-zulu
- sdk use java 17.0.14-zulu

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
# npm start

# OR using Yarn
# yarn start
npx react-native start --reset-cache
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

# Android 오류

yarn android 실행 시 오류
- 안드로이드용 크로스 컴파일러(NDK clang)가 가져와야 할 안드로이드 헤더(=NDK sysroot) 대신, macOS 헤더(Xcode의 MacOSX.sdk)를 먼저 집어서 생긴 오류
- 해결 : 오염된 환경변수 끄고 "깨끗한" 싱태로 빌드
```shell
   # 터밀널에 그대로 붙여넣기
( unset CPATH SDKROOT C_INCLUDE_PATH CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH CFLAGS CPPFLAGS LDFLAGS CC CXX; \
  cd android; rm -rf .cxx app/.cxx .gradle; \
  ./gradlew clean; \
  ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug --no-daemon --stacktrace )
